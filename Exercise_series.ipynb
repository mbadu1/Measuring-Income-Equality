    "# Measuring Income Equality with the Gini Coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "One measure of inequality frequently used by Economists, social scientists, and policy makers is the *[Gini coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient)*. The Gini coefficient takes as input the allocation of some resource — income, wealth, market share, etc. — for all entities in a population and returns a single number between 0 and 1 that summarizes the inequality of the distribution of said resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gini coefficient takes on a value of 1 when the resource distribution is maximally *unequal* across the entities (e.g., one entity has all of the resource and no one else has any), and a value of 0 when the resource is evenly distributed across all entities. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will calculate the Gini Coefficient for income inequality across the countries of the world to get a sense of income inequality *across* countries. \n"
